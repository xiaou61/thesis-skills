# Word Comment Revision Workflow

Use this reference when the user uploads a `.docx` thesis draft with Word comments or asks to revise the paper according to advisor comments.

## Goal

Turn Word comments into a structured revision workflow:

1. Extract comments.
2. Convert them into markdown todos.
3. Plan safe changes.
4. Modify the document using `thesis-docx`/`docx` rules.
5. Log each change and verify the document.

## Extract Comments

Run:

```powershell
python C:\Users\Lenovo\.codex\skills\thesis-standardizer\scripts\extract_docx_comments.py .\draft.docx --out .\paper-context\word-comments
```

Outputs:

```text
paper-context/word-comments/
  word-comments.json
  word-comment-todos.md
  docx-revision-log.md
```

The script extracts comment author, date, text, and the nearest paragraph preview. It does not decide the correct academic revision.

## Revision Process

1. Read `word-comment-todos.md`.
2. Group comments by type:
   - content addition
   - deletion or compression
   - logic/structure adjustment
   - citation/reference issue
   - formatting issue
   - figure/table issue
   - unclear or conflicting comment
3. Map each comment to evidence:
   - thesis specs
   - source code / experiment data
   - literature references
   - school template
   - existing draft text
4. Modify only what the comment justifies.
5. Update `docx-revision-log.md`, `paper-context/workflow/revision-log.md`, and `paper-context/workflow/revision-trace.jsonl`.

## DOCX Editing Rules

- Prefer Microsoft Word automation or the `thesis-docx` skill for layout-sensitive changes.
- For finalized theses, second-round revisions, or any draft with stable pagination, TOC, figure anchors, or cross-references, do not use pandoc to round-trip the main body back into the original `.docx`.
- In those layout-sensitive cases, copy the original `.docx` first and revise it in place with paragraph-level or run-level targeted replacement so the document keeps its original section breaks, headers/footers, TOC fields, figure/table anchors, and image layout.
- Treat "rewrite the whole chapter in markdown and pour it back" as a high-risk path. Use it only when the user explicitly accepts format rebuild risk.
- For content edits, preserve existing styles and section structure.
- Before applying paragraph-index replacements, verify the target paragraph count and inspect paragraph previews so index drift does not silently overwrite the wrong content.
- For comments that require new facts, first add `needs_evidence` instead of inventing content.
- For comments that require citations, first add `needs_source` unless the source is already verified.
- For formatting comments, follow school template first and preserve unspecified formatting.

## Output Contract

After revising by comments, return:

1. comment summary: total / resolved / unresolved
2. revised document path
3. `docx-revision-log.md` path
4. unresolved comments with reasons
5. verification performed or not performed

## Stop Conditions

Do not auto-apply a comment when:

- the comment conflicts with school rules
- the comment requires missing data, source, or screenshot
- the target location is ambiguous
- applying the change would rewrite a large chapter without user approval
- Word/PDF layout fidelity cannot be checked but the change is layout-sensitive
